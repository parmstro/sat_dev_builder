# sat_dev_builder
Created from rhis_builder code, this repo is targeted at building a Satellite and Capsule infrastructure from scratch using the redhat.satellite collection. The primary purpose I created this for was to build out a full infrastructure to develop foreman-ansible-modules and satellite-ansible-modules against. 

The included variables create a fully configured Satellite. 
You can edit the variable files to create whatever configurations you need. 

Part of the goal of this particular adventure is to start building the structure and content to define a bunch of different know configurations for Satellite, with the goal of being able to share them and use them to drive IaC for Satellite configuration and pipelines for testing Standard Operating Environments.

Contributions and Pull Requests welcome.
