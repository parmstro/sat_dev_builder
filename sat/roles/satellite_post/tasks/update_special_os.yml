# This task is called to complete the definition
# for the automatically created OS
# name:RHEL
# The only task required is to add the media to
# the OS definition so that we can kickstart from it
#
# This is a key example of why we need configuration
# analysis at the beginning of the code.
# I would be pissed if I got 12 hours into a build and 
# the code told me "Hey I'm bailing because you specified
# an inconsistent parameter." Then again, RTFM...er, WTFM

# After the initial run, if sub tasks are run, the special OS
# becomes not so special, i.e. we will need to create it from 
# scratch. So test to see if it exists, if yes, update it
# else recreate it
